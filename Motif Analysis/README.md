# Genus-Level Network Motif and Robustness Analysis

## Overview
This project explores plant-pollinator interaction networks at the **genus level**. The goal is to understand how ecological networks maintain stability and respond to node removal (simulated species loss). The analysis focuses on identifying structural motifs and evaluating robustness across multiple European localities.

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3.10 or later.
2. Install dependencies
3. Place `Edges_data_genus_level.csv` and `Nodes_data_genus_level.csv` in `Motif Analysis/data`
4. Run scripts in order:

- main.py
-  analyze_results.py
